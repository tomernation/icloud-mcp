This unified **Apple/iCloud** MCP server supports **Calendar, Contacts, Mail, and optional Reminders**.
The core is a static Go binary; Reminders uses a pinned Python worker. It uses
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) JSON-RPC on **stdio** or the authenticated HTTP transport.

Calendar, Contacts and Mail use CalDAV, CardDAV, IMAP and SMTP with
app-specific passwords. Optional Reminders uses the private iCloud CloudKit
web API with a separately authenticated Apple session and 2FA. It runs
headless on the Pi; no macOS APIs are needed. The Go core also builds for Windows.

CI runs a `windows/amd64` smoke build. GitHub Release archives contain
linux/amd64, linux/arm64, and darwin/arm64 builds. Agents, orchestrators, and
desktop chat applications can use the server.

**Host-agnostic.** Any MCP client can use the server if it starts child processes
with an environment and connects stdin and stdout. Compatible clients include
personal agents, Hermes, OpenClaw, IDE bridges, runners, and other stdio hosts.
The server does not prefer a model vendor, chat product, or reseller. Configure
the server only through its process environment. The binary does not parse
host-specific config files or `.env`.

| Domain | Protocol | Default |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Calendar | CalDAV HTTPS | Always on (read + write unless global read-only) |
| Contacts | CardDAV HTTPS | Off until `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_CONTACTS` |
| Mail read | IMAP TLS | Off until `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL` |
| Mail mutation | IMAP | Off until Mail + `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_WRITE` |
| Mail send | SMTP STARTTLS | Off until Mail + `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_SEND` + recipient policy |
| Reminders | Private CloudKit web API | Off until `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_REMINDERS` + authenticated web session |

Reminders setup, deployment, session renewal, supported fields and limitations
are documented in [Reminders web API](docs/reminders-web-api.md). Notes, Photos,
Drive and Messages remain out of scope. See [Supported scope](#supported-scope).

## Quick start

```bash
go install github.com/ThomasCrouzet/icloud-mcp/cmd/icloud-mcp@latest
# or: make build
# or: make release VERSION=v0.4.0
# or: make release-all VERSION=v0.4.0
```

1. Create an [app-specific password](https://appleid.apple.com). Never use the
   main Apple Account password.
2. Export a minimal environment. For the first deployment, use Calendar
   **read-only** mode:

```bash
export ICLOUD_EMAIL='you@icloud.com'
export ICLOUD_PASSWORD='your-app-specific-password'
export ICLOUD_MCP_READ_ONLY=true
export ICLOUD_MCP_DEFAULT_TZ=Europe/Paris   # owner IANA zone; default UTC
```

3. Register the absolute `icloud-mcp` path as the **command** in your MCP host.
   Register the environment as **env**. The host can use YAML, JSON, TOML, a UI,
   or an orchestrator. The exact format depends on the host.
4. Stdio carries JSON-RPC. **stderr** carries logs and the mutation audit.
   Reload the host after environment changes.

This configuration exposes **7 tools**: Calendar reads, local helpers, and
`icloud_capabilities`. The process does not construct a Contacts or Mail client.

Optional domains (still host-agnostic `export` form):

```bash
# Contacts reads (writes also need ICLOUD_MCP_READ_ONLY=false)
export ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_CONTACTS=true

# Mail reads: IMAP identity may differ from ICLOUD_EMAIL (e.g. name@icloud.com)
export ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL=true
export ICLOUD_MAIL_ADDRESS='mailbox@icloud.com'
# export ICLOUD_MAIL_PASSWORD='...'   # optional; else copy of ICLOUD_PASSWORD

# Mail mutation (flags / move / trash); independent of send
export ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_WRITE=true
export ICLOUD_MCP_READ_ONLY=false

# Mail send: requires exact recipient allowlist even under global read-only
export ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_SEND=true
export ICLOUD_MCP_SMTP_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS='alice@example.com,bob@example.net'
```

You can load secrets from `file://` only at boot. Each file must be a regular
file of at most 4 KiB with mode 0600 or stricter. The server does not read the
file again after startup:

```bash
export ICLOUD_EMAIL='file:///run/secrets/icloud-email'
export ICLOUD_PASSWORD='file:///run/secrets/icloud-password'
export ICLOUD_MAIL_ADDRESS='file:///run/secrets/icloud-mail-address'
export ICLOUD_MAIL_PASSWORD='file:///run/secrets/icloud-mail-password'
```

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full 12-variable contract.

## MCP tools

The server exposes a maximum of **23** tools. Disabled tools are absent from
`tools/list`. The process does not construct clients for disabled domains.

| Count | When |
|------:|------|
| **10** | Default: Calendar read+write + `icloud_capabilities` |
| **7** | Global read-only, optional domains off (recommended first run) |
| **23** | Contacts + Mail read + mutation + send, read-only off |

`ICLOUD_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` removes every Calendar/Contacts write, every Mail
mutation, and Mail send. It does not enable a disabled read domain.

| Group | Tools |
|-------|--------|
| Global | `icloud_capabilities` |
| Calendar read | `list_calendars`, `search_events`, `get_event`, `find_free_slots`, `validate_event`, `calendar_capabilities` |
| Calendar write | `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event` |
| Contacts read | `list_address_books`, `search_contacts`, `get_contact` |
| Contacts write | `create_contact`, `update_contact`, `delete_contact` |
| Mail read | `list_mailboxes`, `search_messages`, `get_message` |
| Mail mutation | `set_message_flags`, `move_message`, `trash_message` |
| Mail send | `send_message` |

**Highlights:** Calendar update and delete operations understand occurrences
and use strong `If-Match`. Contacts uses opaque book IDs and writes vCard 3.0.
Mail uses `(mailbox, UIDVALIDITY, UID)` identities, PEEK reads, and an exact
recipient policy for SMTP. `set_message_flags` fails closed with
`protocol_error` when CONDSTORE is advertised. This occurs because go-imap
beta.8 cannot observe tagged MODIFIED. See the full behavior notes:
[docs/caldav-compatibility.md](docs/caldav-compatibility.md),
[docs/carddav-compatibility.md](docs/carddav-compatibility.md),
[docs/mail-compatibility.md](docs/mail-compatibility.md).

### Create UIDs and update idempotency

`create_event` and `create_contact` use `client_uid` or its `idempotency_key`
alias as the resource UID. A create returns `conflict` if that UID exists.
It never silently overwrites the object.

Only `update_event` and `update_contact` use the **process-local result cache**
through `idempotency_key`. Keys have separate tool namespaces. The two tools
share a limit of **1,024 entries**, with at most **256 KiB per cached payload**.
The same key and parameters return the saved result, including its `IsError`
flag. The domain applies redaction and result limits again. Different parameters,
including a different `etag`, return `conflict`.

Success and definitive domain errors stay for **15 minutes after the request
completes**. Unknown outcomes, unclassified errors, and internal errors stay
**until process exit**. Response serialization or size errors after a successful
write also stay until process exit. Pending claims never expire. A cancelled or
timed-out duplicate caller does not release the original request's claim.

A full cache rejects new claims with `conflict` before the write. Keep the key.
Wait for capacity. After an ambiguous response, read with `get_event` or
`get_contact` before choosing a new key. A new key or process restart does not
prove that the previous write failed. Use a fresh strong `etag` for any necessary
new update.

See the [cache contract](docs/architecture.md#update-idempotency) and
[recovery procedure](docs/error-codes.md#update-idempotency-and-recovery).

## Configuration

Exactly **12** product environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Contract |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `ICLOUD_EMAIL` | none | Required Calendar/Contacts identity. `file://` supported (regular file, <=4 KiB, mode 0600+). |
| `ICLOUD_PASSWORD` | none | Required app-specific password. Mail uses it as a fallback. `file://` as above. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_READ_ONLY` | `false` | Global mutation kill switch. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Stderr level. See the accepted forms below. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_DEFAULT_TZ` | `UTC` | IANA zone for offset-less Calendar inputs and recurring-write fallback. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_CONTACTS` | `false` | Contacts tools. Writes require read-only mode to be off. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL` | `false` | Mail reads. Requires a Mail address and password. |
| `ICLOUD_MAIL_ADDRESS` | none | Full IMAP/SMTP address when Mail is on. `file://` as above. |
| `ICLOUD_MAIL_PASSWORD` | `ICLOUD_PASSWORD` | Optional dedicated Mail app password. `file://` as above. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_WRITE` | `false` | Three IMAP mutation tools. |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_ENABLE_MAIL_SEND` | `false` | `send_message` (independent of Mail write). |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_SMTP_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS` | none | Required if send is on. Use exact addresses or literal `*`. Literal `*` causes a boot warning. Use exact addresses when possible. |

Booleans accept only unset, `0`, `false`, `1`, or `true`. Invalid values cause a
boot failure. The server validates the configuration **before** network access.
Mail write or send without Mail causes a boot error. Mail without an address or
password also causes a boot error. Send without a recipient policy causes a
boot error, including in read-only mode.

Global read-only can coexist with write and send flags, but it prevents their
registration.

The server trims log levels and ignores case. It accepts `debug` or `-4`,
`info`, `warn`, `warning`, or `2`, and `error` or `4`. Unset or unrecognized
values use `info`.

Use `-version` to print the version. The optional
`-health 127.0.0.1:port` flag serves `/healthz` and `/status` on loopback. Both
endpoints return JSON with domains and rate limits. The optional
`-audit-format=json|text` flag selects the mutation audit format on stderr.
The default format is `json`.

### Dates

- Calendar **input** `start` and `end` accept RFC3339 with an offset. They also
  accept wall-clock values without an offset in `ICLOUD_MCP_DEFAULT_TZ`. Use
  values without an offset for the user's local time. Recurring creates and
  creates with an explicit timezone write TZID and VTIMEZONE. Non-recurring
  timed creates default to UTC `Z` on the wire. All-day creates use
  `VALUE=DATE`.
- Calendar **output** uses RFC3339 for timed events. It always includes an
  explicit numeric offset in `ICLOUD_MCP_DEFAULT_TZ`, never bare `Z`. All-day
  dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`. See `calendar_capabilities.outputFormat`.
- Contacts birthdays: write `YYYY-MM-DD` only.
- Mail search: `since` inclusive, `before` exclusive (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

## Security (summary)

Untrusted remote text can influence an LLM on the host. Labels do not form a
security boundary. A compromised model can call every **registered** tool. This
risk applies to every host and vendor.

- **Egress fixed:** Calendar uses `caldav.icloud.com` and matching
  `p[0-9]{1,3}-caldav.icloud.com:443` hosts. Contacts uses matching Contacts
  hosts. IMAP uses `imap.mail.me.com:993`. SMTP uses
  `smtp.mail.me.com:587` with mandatory STARTTLS. Destinations are not
  configurable. The server ignores DAV proxy environment variables and verifies
  TLS 1.2 or later.
- **Isolation:** each domain has separate credentials, transports, dialers,
  limiters, semaphores, and protocol stacks. No authenticated HTTP client
  connects to multiple domains.
- **Secrets:** the server removes secrets, including Basic and SASL PLAIN forms.
  Boot-only `file://` reads require mode 0600 or stricter. The server does not
  use `os/exec` or telemetry. It does not write to disk after boot.
- **Audit:** mutation logs include `domain`, `resourceType`, and the process-local
  HMAC `resourceToken`. They never contain raw paths, UIDs, mailboxes, or
  recipients.
- **Residual risk:** one process holds credentials for all enabled domains.
  Feature flags do not remove compiled code. For stronger isolation, use
  read-only mode and enable fewer domains. You can also use a dedicated Mail
  password or separate processes.

## Limits (summary)

| | |
|--|--|
| Tool deadline | 25s (DAV HTTP 30s) |
| Stdio / MCP result | 1 MiB frame. 256 KiB result. Reflected protocol errors have a limit. |
| Calendar | Search range: 366 days. Results: 400 total, 2,500 per calendar, and 10,000 materialized across calendars. Recurrence: 2,000 expansions, 100k steps per series, and 250k steps per search. Rate: 60 reads and 20 writes per minute. Concurrency: 4 reads and 2 writes. |
| Contacts | 100 books. 100 summaries. 2000 cards scanned. Rate: 60 reads and 20 writes per minute. Concurrency: 4. |
| Mail | Rate: 60 reads, 20 mutations, and 20 sends per minute. Semaphores: 2 reads, 1 mutation, and 1 send. No mutation or send retry. |
| Writes | No automatic replay of Calendar PUT/DELETE, Contacts writes, IMAP mutations, or SMTP. Ambiguous outcomes use `outcome_unknown`. |

The server discovers Calendar at boot and Contacts when first used. Each call
uses a fresh IMAP or SMTP session. See these documents for rates, parser
budgets, and retry rules:
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md), [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Supported scope

| Data | Connector | Support |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Calendar | CalDAV | Always |
| Contacts | CardDAV | Optional |
| Mail read / mutation / send | IMAP + SMTP | Optional, independently gated |
| Modern Reminders | Private CloudKit web API + Python worker | Optional, separate Apple web session |
| Notes, Photos, Drive, Find My, Keychain, Messages, Home | No connector implemented | Excluded |

The server does not treat modern Reminders as generic CalDAV VTODO. Apple's
third-party documentation for this type of access covers Mail, Calendar, and
Contacts.

**Multi-account:** one process holds one iCloud identity. Start a separate
`icloud-mcp` process for each identity. Give each process a separate environment
and, if needed, a separate `-health` port. The MCP host can multiplex these
processes. See [docs/agent-hosts.md](docs/agent-hosts.md).

## Dependencies

Use Go 1.26.0 or newer. The project has one module and exactly **10** direct
dependencies. If you add a direct dependency, add its justification here.

| Dependency | Exact version | Justification |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| `github.com/emersion/go-webdav` | `v0.7.0` | CalDAV primitives. Discovery and conditional operations remain hand-written. |
| `github.com/emersion/go-ical` | `v0.0.0-20250609112844-439c63cef608` | iCalendar parse/encode |
| `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` | `v0.57.0` | MCP stdio, schemas, JSON-RPC |
| `github.com/teambition/rrule-go` | `v1.8.2` | Bounded recurrence with timezone preservation |
| `golang.org/x/time` | `v0.16.0` | Per-domain rate limiters |
| `github.com/emersion/go-vcard` | `v0.1.0` | vCard 3.0/4.0 read, 3.0 write |
| `github.com/emersion/go-imap/v2` | `v2.0.0-beta.8` | IMAP behind `internal/mail/imapadapter` |
| `github.com/emersion/go-message` | `v0.18.2` | MIME / plain-text bounds |
| `github.com/emersion/go-smtp` | `v0.25.0` | SMTP + STARTTLS |
| `github.com/emersion/go-sasl` | `v0.0.0-20241020182733-b788ff22d5a6` | SASL PLAIN after STARTTLS |

## Build and test

```bash
make build        # local host binary, VERSION defaults to dev
make test         # go test ./... -race -cover
make lint         # go vet + pinned golangci-lint
make release VERSION=v0.4.0      # packaged linux/arm64, digest-pinned Go 1.26.8 image
make release-all VERSION=v0.4.0  # packaged linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 (host Go)
make install      # host-compatible build to INSTALL_DIR (default ~/.local/bin)
```

Release targets reject an unset version or a `dev` version. Archives contain
the binary, `LICENSE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. The `dist/` directory also
contains a SHA-256 checksum file. GitHub tag releases run `make release-all`
only after CI and gitleaks succeed for that tag. They use Go 1.26.8 with
`check-latest` disabled.

Local `make release` uses the digest-pinned container path for linux/arm64.
Release blobs include cosign keyless signatures. `-version` first uses the
release ldflags value. If this value is absent, it uses Go module build
information. Thus, `go install ...@version` reports the module version.

CI runs race tests, fuzz smoke, govulncheck, gitleaks, and
multi-architecture builds. It also checks coverage, egress and security AST
guards, binary size, and public text. Aggregate coverage must be at least 78%.
Package floors include `cmd/icloud-mcp` and `internal/health`. The build check
includes windows/amd64 smoke. The binary budget is 20 MiB.

The public-text policy checks the tree and new commits. Live iCloud tests use
the `integration` build tag. These tests are optional and never run in CI. See
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

For fixture-only protocol evidence, use an absolute output path outside the
repository:

```bash
make protocol-evidence EVIDENCE_DIR=/external/path
```

The runner builds an executable from `cmd/icloud-mcp` tests with shared MCP
registration and stdio startup code. It also runs in-process idempotency and
recurrence scenarios. It saves transcripts, run metadata, source revision,
working diff, fixture SHA-256 values, and results outside the repository.
CI keeps the `protocol-evidence` artifact for 14 days. These checks use synthetic
fixtures and do not establish live iCloud compatibility.
